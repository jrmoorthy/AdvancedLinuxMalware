Beyond TTPs: Syscall analysis of Linux Malware used in Advanced Persistent Threats


Abstract:
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are increasingly leveraging sophisticated malware to target critical Linux systems such as IoT, cloud infrastructures, and Operational Technology (OT) environments. Although the cybersecurity community has made significant progress in documenting Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK often fail to capture the evolving and multifaceted nature of APT malware capabilities. This study proposes a systematic approach to summarizing malware functionality through static analysis.

We analyzed 460 recent advanced Linux malware samples, including IoT-specific malware, spanning diverse families, types, and architectures such as x86, ARM, PowerPC, and SPARC. Through reverse engineering, we extracted system calls and categorized them into predefined functional groups and security risk rankings based on existing research. Using a Random Forest classifier, we classified malware types based on these syscalls and performed a feature importance analysis to identify the top syscalls driving classification. In addition, we analyze unique and overlapping syscall patterns of closely related malware types, such as Botnet, Backdoors, and Remote Access Trojan.

This research demonstrates the effectiveness of static analysis in capturing complex malware behavior, providing insights for enhanced threat detection and capability profiling independent of existing threat-mapping frameworks.
